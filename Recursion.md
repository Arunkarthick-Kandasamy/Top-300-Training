# Recursion :
    - Recurtion is a function that calls itself .
    ## Base Condition :
        - It is a condition where the recursion stop making new calls .
        - If there is no Base Condition , then there is no chance to stop the recursion , this leads to stack memory gets filled . and results in stack overflow condition .
        - It is simplier that answers that you already have .
    ## Why Recurtion ?
        - It helps in solving bigger / complex problems in simpler way .
        - Space Complexity is not constant .

When a function gets terminated from stack memory ?
    - If the function is not finished exceuting , it will remain in stack .
    - If the function completed all its excution then it will be removed from stack and the flow of program returned to the line where the function is called .
